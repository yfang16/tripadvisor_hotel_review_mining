R: Mining script to collect text of reviews left on TripAdvisor

17 Apr 2019
This was a project I did in collaboration with a hotelier consultant. The objective of the study was to understand what customers look for when staying at a hotel. An efficient way is to understand this is to collect customer reviews from websites such as tripadvisor to get insights. This script scrapes tripadvisor website and collects the text of reviews and breaks down the text into individual words to count their occurence. This particular example looks at the Marina Bay Sands hotel in Singapore.

Update Oct 2020: The website structure of Tripadvisor has changed and the script no longer works as it is very specific to the structure of the site.
